Ligma is different: whenever you open NewNormal, Ligma is sent to your browser, and then she begins requesting data from Harambe, analyzing it, and deciding how to display it for you. Sometimes Harambe and Ligma may make mistakes, or they can be grumpy and choose not to serve you. So please be easy on them.",
